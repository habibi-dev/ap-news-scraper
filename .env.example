GEMINI_PROMPT_TRANSLATE='You are given a list of news items in JSON format. Each item includes "title", and "content". Your task is to rewrite each item in **Persian**, following these rules:
                         1. Translate and rewrite the news item in Persian using a **neutral and informative tone**, without expressing opinions or emotions. The rewritten content must appear as a **neutral report**, not quoting or referencing any source or person.
                         2. The translated content must be **2 to 4 lines long**, fluent, and easy to understand.
                         3. The **translatedTitle** must start with a relevant **emoji** that reflects the subject. Avoid emotional or expressive emojis such as ‚ù§Ô∏è or üò¢.
                         4. The **translatedContent** must NOT start with an emoji. Emojis may be used **sparingly within the content only if directly relevant**.
                         5. Do NOT include any names of media outlets, individuals, or organizations from the original content. Simply explain what happened or is happening.
                         6. Do not add, change, or assume information beyond the original text.
                         7. Do NOT include any links or references to the original source.
                         8. After the translatedContent, insert one line break and then exactly **one set of relevant Persian hashtags**, summarizing the main topic(s).
                         9. Return the result as a valid **raw JSON object** with exactly these two fields:
                            - "translatedTitle": the Persian title, starting with an emoji
                            - "translatedContent": the Persian content, followed by a line break and the hashtags
                         10. The entire output must be in Persian and returned in **raw JSON format only** ‚Äî no explanations, markdown, or formatting.'
GEMINI_PROMPT_REVIEW='You are given a list of news items in JSON format. Each item contains a "title", "link", and "id". Your task is to analyze the list and return a clean JSON array following these rules:
                      * For duplicate or similar news titles, keep only the most complete and informative one, and mark the rest as "rejected".
                      * Mark a news item as "pending\_translation" if:
                        * It is directly relevant to Iranian people (e.g., Iranian politics, economy, society, culture, internet, sanctions, etc.).
                        * Or, it covers globally significant events with indirect impact or high interest for Iranians (e.g., major international conflicts, oil prices, Big Tech announcements, climate change, AI breakthroughs, major political shifts in the world).
                      * Use semantic similarity, keyword overlap, or obvious topic repetition to detect duplicates or near-duplicates.
                      * Use your general knowledge about Iranian society and global affairs to evaluate the importance of each news item.
                      **Return a valid JSON array containing only the items with status "pending\_translation", each with:**
                      * `"id"`: the ID of the item
                      * `"status"`: always "pending\_translation"
                      **Do NOT include rejected items. Do NOT include any explanations, markdown, or formatting ‚Äì just return the pure JSON array.**'
